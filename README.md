# Matic Test assignment
​
Our intent is to get a feel for your thought process as well as your source code organization and testability.
​
It's not required that you solve all of the problems / tasks in this document. We value your time and efforts. Feel free to skip any part of this assignment while still giving us a chance to enjoy the results of your work that best demonstrate your skills and code style.
​
We would like to know the approximate time you spent on the solution. We do not take time of submission into account in our overall evaluation.
​
We expect to see source code as a git repository with instructions on how to use it.

_Please let us know if you have any questions._
​
#### Task: Fetch ‘n’ Cache application
- The user should be able to fetch Rick and Morty character by entering a numeric value into the search field and clicking on the Search button.
- Disable the button and search field when there are network requests in progress
- If the character was fetched before, it should be loaded instantly from the cache (no redundant AJAX requests).
- Show a list of cached characters on the right side of the page
- If a user clicks on an image of the character, display the character on the screen
- Highlight the selected character in the cached list if that character is currently on the screen
- Allow the user to clear the cache entirely by clicking on the Clear All button
​
#### BONUS tasks:
- Allow the user to clear certain characters from the cache by clicking on the X button
- When the input field contains an id of the character that is on the cache, instantaneously display the cached data on the screen
- Cache all data in the browser memory (so that it persists after reload)
- Experiment with automatic cache invalidation after some period of time
- The code is covered with automation tests
